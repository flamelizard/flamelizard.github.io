I called Jack when my flat got flooded. He helped me to dry the place and now
it is barely noticeable where the water reached. Thank you.

When my husband got sick, there was too much work at our family estate. I do
not know how I'd handle that without Jack. It was such a relief to let him the hard work so I can just take care of my husband.

Yo, I finally got my driving license. Was worried from previous failures. Well, he ain't doing any psychology but yet he spent some time with me driving around and it worked !
